NSA Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux) is an implementation of a
flexible and fine-grained mandatory access control (MAC) architecture
called Flask in the Linux kernel<citation><XRef
LinkEnd="LoscoccoFreenix01"></citation>.  SELinux can enforce an
administratively-defined security policy over all processes and
objects in the system, basing decisions on labels containing a variety
of security-relevant information.  The architecture provides
flexibility by cleanly separating the policy decision-making logic
from the policy enforcement logic.  The policy decision-making logic
is encapsulated within a single component known as the security server
with a general security interface.  A wide range of security models
can be implemented as security servers without requiring any changes
to any other component of the system.

<para>
To demonstrate the architecture, SELinux provides an example security
server that implements a combination of Type Enforcement
(TE)<citation><XRef LinkEnd="BoebertNCSC85"></citation>, Role-Based
Access Control (RBAC)<citation><XRef
LinkEnd="FerraioloNCSC92"></citation>, and optionally Multi-Level
Security (MLS).  These security models provide significant flexibility
through a set of policy configuration files.  An example security
policy configuration was developed to demonstrate how SELinux can be
used to meet certain security goals and to provide a starting point
for users <citation><XRef

This technical report describes how to configure the SELinux security
policy for the example security server.  <xref linkend="arch">
explains concepts defined by the Flask architecture that are important
to configuring the policy.  <xref linkend="model"> describes the
security model implemented by the example security server.  The policy
language and the example policy configuration are described in <xref

built and applied to the system.  Configuration files for security-aware applications are discussed in <xref linkend="apps">.  <xref
linkend="examples"> describes how to customize the policy for various
purposes.

<comment>Note:  This report predates the transition from using the original NSA example policy configuration to using the reference policy, and the transition from monolithic policy to modular/managed policy.  Thus, while some of the discussion herein is still applicable, much has changed in modern SELinux systems.</comment>
