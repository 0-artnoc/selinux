This is a (partial) credits file of organizations and people who have
contributed to the SELinux project.  It is modeled after the Linux
kernel CREDITS file, i.e. it is sorted by name and uses the following
fields for each entry: name (N), email (E), web-address (W), and
description (D).  Unlike the Contributors web page
(http://www.nsa.gov/selinux/info/contrib.cfm), this file does not
partition the list into different categories of contributions;
it is merely a flat listing of all contributors.
